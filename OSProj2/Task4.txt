A kernel module, or loadable kernel module (LKM), is a piece of software that can be dynamically 
loaded into the Linux kernel to extend its functionality or introduce new features. These modules 
interact directly with the kernel, accessing its internal functions and data structures. Common uses
for kernel modules include device drivers, filesystems, and low-level system tasks. 
 
On the other hand, a system call is a mechanism provided by the operating system that allows 
user-level processes to request services from the kernel. When a process makes a system call, 
it transitions from user mode to kernel mode, and the kernel performs the requested operation 
on behalf of the process. System calls provide an interface for applications to interact with 
the kernel, enabling tasks such as file operations, process management, and memory allocation. 

The main distinction between kernel modules and system calls lies in their purpose and scope: kernel
modules extend the functionality of the kernel itself, while system calls facilitate communication 
between user-level processes and the kernel.

Regarding the example from the article, its functionality in a modern virtual machine (VM) may vary 
depending on several factors. Primarily, it hinges on the compatibility of the example with the VM's 
kernel version. If the kernel version aligns with the one used when the article was written, the example
may work seamlessly. However, if there have been substantial changes or updates to the kernel since then, 
the example may encounter issues due to differences in API, data structures, or internal mechanisms. 

The availability of compatibility layers or support for older features in modern kernels may influence 
the example's functionality. While these layers can aid backward compatibility, there's no guarantee that
the example will work flawlessly. The presence of specific dependencies such as configurations
or libraries crucial for the example's operation may affect its compatibility with the modern VM environment. 
 
Overall, determining the functionality of the example in a modern setting may require testing and consideration
of various factors.
